## Publish your site 

![Publish](https://cdn.blutui.com/uploads/assets/Help/agency/site-settings/publishing/screenshot-2026-01-15-at-94503-am.png?format=webp&width=800)

Click the `Publish` button in the top-right corner of the screen. It’s that simple.

Before publishing, your site should also have a domain connected.  
If you haven’t set this up yet, see our guide on [managing domains](/console/site-settings/managing-domains).
