After clicking the `Add page` button, a dialog will appear where you need to fill in the following details:

### Page Name

Enter a name for your page. This will be used to identify the page in the dashboard and can also be used as the page title.

### Page URL

Set the URL path for your page. This determines where the page will be accessible on your site (e.g., `/about` or `/contact-us`).

### Layout

Select a layout template for your page. The layout determines the structure and design of your page.

If the layout you need is not available in the dropdown, contact your developer to add it to your project. Layouts are created by developers in the project's codebase.
