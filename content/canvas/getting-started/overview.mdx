## What is Blutui Canvas?

A Canvas determines the way a project will look and feel for your client's project. Blutui project's are built using Blutui's templating language, Canvas, as well as HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript. As a developer you can custom Canvas for every client project that goes through your Agency or build a template and use that as the foundation for all your client web projects.

### What is a template?

A template is a regular text file. It can generate any text-based format (HTML, XML, CSV, LaTeX, etc.).

A template contains **variables** or **expressions**, which get replaced with values when the template is evaluated, and **tags**, which control the template's logic.

Below is a minimal template that illustrates a few basics. We will cover further details later on:

```canvas
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Webpage</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <ul id="navigation">
      {% for item in navigation>
        <li><a href="{{ item.href }}">{{ item.caption }}</a></li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>

    <h1>My Webpage</h1>
    {{ a_variable }}
  </body>
</html>
```

There are two kinds of delimiters: `{% ...>` and `{{ ... }}`. The first one is used to execute statements such as for-loops, the latter outputs the result of an expression.

## Project structure

The Canvas file structure gives you the ability to structure your project in a way that suits your workflow. However you are **required** to include the `public/` and `views/` folders. The following is a breakdown of there are required folders:

- `public`: This directory contains your projects public assets. CSS, JS, and image files can all be found in this folder and are accessible from your browser.
- `views`: This directory is the location for your projects `.html` or `.canvas` template files. All files in this folder are used by the Blutui platform to render your client's project.

The folder structure within the `public` and `views` directory is completely up to you. 

**Create a page through the Project Dashboard**: First, create a `layouts` folder inside your `views` directory and add a layout file (e.g., `views/layouts/default.html`). Then, go to the Project Dashboard and create a new page through the **Pages** menu, specifying your layout. The layout path is always relative to the `views/layouts` directory of your project.

  Ensure that you run `courier push` after each update, to view your changes in the staging environment.
