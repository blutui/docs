## Branding 

This is where you can configure the whitelabel branding for your agency.

![Branding section](https://cdn.blutui.com/uploads/assets/Help/agency/organisation-settings/branding/brandin-new.png?format=webp&width=800)

This where you can set your `Logo`, `Primary colour` and `Secondary colour`.
This brand will then show up in the agency console, site dashboard and emails sent from the site to your clients.
