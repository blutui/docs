title: How do turn a Figma design into a Blutui Project?
description: Learn how to convert your Figma designs into fully functional Blutui projects.

## Introduction

Transforming a static Figma mockup into a live, data-driven Blutui site used to require hours of manual translation. With the Blutui MCP, that gap has effectively disappeared. By connecting your design environment directly to your development tools, you can now move from a Figma frame to a production-ready Blutui project with unprecedented speed.

This workflow isn't just about copying the mockup and generating code, it’s about using AI to intelligently map your Figma layers to Blutui Collections, Forms, Canvas, Pages, layouts and so on. By the end of this guide, you’ll know how to orchestrate multiple MCP servers to turn visual components into functional, manageable code.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following set up:

- **A Figma account with a design file:** A project file with clearly defined layers (ideally using Auto Layout for better CSS translation)..
- **Figma MCP server:** setup and configured.
- **Blutui MCP server:** setup and configured. [Learn more about setting up Blutui MCP here](/docs/getting-started/agentic-development).
- **MCP-Compatible AI Assistant:** An AI coding assistant that supports MCP integration (e.g., Cursor, Claude Code, VS Code etc).
