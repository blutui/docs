## **Introduction**

### **What is Blutui?**

Blutui is a Content Management System (CMS) built for the creative industry with the goal of providing Front-End Developers with design freedom. Your designers use their favourite tools within the Blutui platform and the agency dashboard provides clarity for account managers and clients. We take care of the backend, so you can focus on what matters; your content.
