## How to edit audio files

Canopy's user-friendly interface makes editing audio files a smooth process.

## Here's how to get started

### 1. Locate the Audio
Identify the audio file you want to edit on your page. Canopy uses visual indicators like highlighted areas or bounding boxes to show editable elements.

Alternatively, you can also employ one of the following methods to locate your editable items.

- Click the **Toggle Guides** button to visually highlight all editable regions on the page.
- Utilize the **Component Tree** to navigate and identify the specific audio element within the page structure.

### 2. Select the Audio
Simply click on the audio file you want to modify.

### 3. Edit in the Sidebar
Once selected, a sidebar will appear on the right side of the interface. This sidebar will display the editing options for the chosen audio element.

**Type:** Enter the MIME type of your audio file in this textbox.

Common audio formats include:

- audio/mpeg (MP3)
- audio/wav (WAV)
- audio/ogg (Ogg)

It's important to choose the appropriate MIME type for your audio file to ensure proper playback across different browsers.

**URL:** Enter the complete web address (URL) of your audio file in this textbox.

### 4. Make Your Changes
Simply modify the content directly within the sidebar. The changes will be reflected in real-time on the actual page, allowing you to preview your edits as you go. When you're happy with the changes click on **Update** to save the changes.
