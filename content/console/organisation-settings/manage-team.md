## Team

Before inviting someone to your agency, you must have an available seat. Seat availability is displayed at the top of the Team page, showing your total seats, current members, and remaining seats.
To invite a new team member, click Invite member.
If you don’t have any remaining seats, click Add seats (next to Invite member) to open the seats management panel and add additional seats before continuing with the invitation.
