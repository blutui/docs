### Creating a site with Blutui is fast and straightforward, and you can get started straight away

- You'll only be billed once you add a domain and publish the site.
- You can build a full site while unpublished prior to going live. In this mode, all CMS features are available.

When you first log in, you'll be presented with a message asking you to create a site. Give your site a name and click `Create Site`. That’s it — you’ve created your first site. The site will appear in your **Sites** tab, where you can edit settings and log into it.

The default Blutui canvas starts as a blank project with a `Public` and `Views` folder. [See the folder structure guide](/docs/getting-started/folder-structure)

Once created, the site will appear when you sync using Courier. From there, you can edit the code locally and push or pull changes to your site.

To start using Blutui Courier, read our [getting started guide](/docs/courier/getting-started).
