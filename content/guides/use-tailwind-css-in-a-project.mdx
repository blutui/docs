## Introduction

TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid development of web interfaces. This guide will walk you through integrating TailwindCSS with your Blutui project.

### Starting a New Project

To create a new Blutui project with Tailwind CSS pre-configured, use the Courier CLI. This setup streamlines your workflow by automating the initial boilerplate.

#### 1. Run the Create Command

```bash
courier create
```

#### 2. Configure Your Canvas

```bash
-> ~ courier create
 ✔ What is your project name? > [project-handle]
 ? Which Canvas would you like to use?
   | base
   | Bare bones Canvas for Blutui.

   | tailwindcss
   | Bare bones Canvas with Tailwind CSS for Blutui.

   | tailwindcss-js
   | Bare bones Canvas with Tailwind CSS + Parcel.js for Blutui.

   | headless-nextjs-blank
   | Bare bones Next.js Canvas for Blutui Headless.
```

<Callout>
  Choose **tailwindcss** for a standard setup or **tailwindcss-js** if you require Parcel.js for custom JavaScript
  logic.
</Callout>

#### 3. Verification

Once the process completes, your project is fully initialized and Tailwind CSS is ready for use.

### Existing Project

If you already have a Blutui project and want to add Tailwind CSS manually, follow these steps to add it into your current project.

### Prerequisites

- A Blutui project set up and ready to go.
- A package manager (`npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, or `bun`) installed. If not, refer to the using a package manager in a Blutui project guide.

### Getting started

#### 1. Installing Tailwind CSS

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to your Blutui project directory. Begin by installing TailwindCSS using:

```npm
npm install -D tailwindcss @tailwindcss/cli
```

#### 2. Import Tailwind in your CSS

Add the import to your main CSS file.

```css tab="global.css"
@import 'tailwindcss';
```

#### 3. Setting up the source directory

Create a `src` folder at the root of your project, so you have `src`, `public`, and `views` folders. This structure allows TailwindCSS to only compile the classes you're using. Inside the `src` folder, create a `styles` sub-folder and then add a `main.css` file within it. Add the following directives in the `main.css` file:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

#### 4. Compiling Tailwind CSS

Execute the following command:

```npm
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/styles/main.css -o ./public/main.css --watch
```

This command compiles the CSS and outputs it to the `public` folder, making it ready to link in your template.

### Conclusion

You've now successfully integrated TailwindCSS with your Blutui project! This setup ensures that your site benefits from the rapid and efficient styling capabilities of TailwindCSS. Enjoy your streamlined development process!
